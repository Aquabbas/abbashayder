## Who am I?

Hi! My name is Abbas. I love learning and building tools that I would like to use.
My favorite food is Mediterranean and Middle Eastern. I love the color blue, and
I drink immense amounts of water, which is how I got my `Aqua/Aquabbas` nickname
from friends in university.

As a kid, I used to hang out with my grandparents on their farm, which influenced
my love for nature immensely. Besides nature, I love running, and gymnastic rings.
I find joy in working with tools like [NeoVim](https://neovim.io), and I'm really
interested in exploring and learning about [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html)/
[Linux](https://www.linux.org/pages/download), servers, and other nerdy stuff.

## Values

1. Knowledge and understanding > copy-paste solutions.
2. People, kindness, and autonomy > processes and ceremonies.
3. Quality work > quantity work.

## Learning Journey

- **2024**:
  - [x] learned to use NeoVim as my [main personal integrated environment]()
  - [x] Transitioned to GNU/Linux as my [main operating system]()
  - [x] Focused on [product development for property managers](https://odevo.com)
- This year (**2025**):
  - [ ] Learning to use [Laravel](https://laravel.com) in a production environment
  - [ ] bare-metal self-hosting, and setting up a homelab using:
    - [ ] [NixOS](https://nixos.org)
    - [ ] [k3s](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s)
    - [ ] Implementing [GitOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-gitops)
          using [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2)
- Next year (**2026**):
  - [ ] I'm interested in learning a new language. Perhaps [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)
        and [Phoenix LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html)
  - [ ] I would also like to dip my toes into launching SaaS applications specialized
        in health/fitness (V1 will be mainly for me)

_Essentially, I am interested in systems that are **scalable**, **fault-tolerant**,
simple to maintain, and that facilitate collaboration with other developers._
