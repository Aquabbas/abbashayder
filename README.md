# My Personal Website

This is my personal website hosted on `Vercel`, where I write about tech, health,
and things I learn along the way.

## Project Struture

```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page
is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where I like to put
any Astro (`.astro`) components.

The `src/content/` directory contains "collections" of related Markdown and MDX
documents. Use `getCollection()` to retrieve posts from `src/content/blog/`, and
type-check your frontmatter using an optional schema. See
[Astro's Content Collections docs](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/)
to learn more.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
